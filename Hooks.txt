life cycle hooks:
================
	life cycle hooks are special methods provided by angular that allows
us to tap into diffrent stage of a components lifecycle. from the moment a
compoent is created to the moment it is destroyed, angular provides hooks
that let us run custom logic at specific times.


we have 8 diff life cycle hooks available in angular

ngOninit:
*********
	called once after the component is intialized.
ngonChanges:
***********
	Called every time an input property changes.
ngDoCheck:
**********
	called during every change detection run.
ngAfterContentInit:
*******************
	called once after the components content has been initialized.
ngAfterContentChecked:
*********************
	Called after every check of the components content.
ngAfterViewInit:
****************
	called once after the components view has been initialized.

ngAfterViewChecked:
******************
	called after every check of the components view.
ngOndestroy:

				ngOnchange
				**********
called every time an input property changes.


example:sociale media profile pic changes 
when we change profile every time those changes displayed ontime.


				ngOninit
				********
called once after the component is initialized.

ngOninit is called only once in the components lifecycle, right-after the component 
has been initialized.






AfterViewInit:
==============
A Callback method that is invoked immediately after angular has coomplpeted initialization of a components view.
it is invoked only once when the view is instantiated.
