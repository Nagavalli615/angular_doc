interfaces are a feature of typescript that allows us to define the structure or shape of an 
object and specify the properties and methodes that an object has or should have.
their primary function is type checking and aiding devlopers iin catching type-related errors during 
development.

use interface keyword to define interfaces.

ex:
===
	export interface post{}
when define array generally pass any type.
when use interface we use 
posts:array<post>{}
like above that post interface used to if we did any mistake in array values it throws tyoe-error


we can use this interface in any file by import.

2nd approach:
=============
	generate interface by useing angular cli 
		
		ng g interface interface-name.

if we want any other optional fields in interface just use ? after key 

export interface User {
  name: string,
  id:string,
  city:string,
  job ?:string
} like this
