STRING INTERPOLATION:
=====================

what we give in ts file render in html file with {{}} in between brases

this is called string interpolation

why we called this string interpolation?

the main reason is what we give inbitween the brases 
eod it gives string type only 

{{1+2}} if we give like this 
ans: 3 will display but the type of the 3 is string 

what we give inbetween the brases boolean or string or numaric values 
eod it convert the data into string


PROPERTY BINDING:
=================
if want to display imag property from ts o ui 
use {{}} this 

<img src"what wegivein ts file variable"/>
this is one way to bind imag 

but better practice is property binding like below

for property binding we use [] 
use [] for src to bind the image fromts file 



CLASS BINDING:
==============
if we want to apply changes conditionally with css 
we use class binding 

for this class binding 
[class.active] = 'isactive'

in this cinario CLASS is property
ACTIVE is css class 
ISACTIVE is ts file varible

if we set isactive = true 
and active {
backgroundcolour : green}

it will dipplay in ui green clr 

in class binding we do changes with string also 

 <button [class.apple]="fruit == 'apple'">change with string</button> 
like this 

in ts file fruit:string = 'apple';
class.apple -- apple is css class styles

DATABINDING & EVENT HANDLING PART2:
===================================

STYLE BINDING:
==============
 in this style binding we use [style] property 

for example 

 <button [style.background]="isclr?'green':'orange'">clickme</button>

to this style binding we dirrectly change clrs to a property 
if u add more styles with this style binding 
search html dom style object in google 
use what tyle of u dom styles 

EVENT BINDING:
=============
for event binding use ().

<button (click)="data()">click event binding</button>

TEMPLATE VARIABLE:
=================
with template variab 
use this template variable # with this

TWOWAY DATA BINDING:
===================
we use this approch to manipulating user data 
send and recive data from component file to html file 
html file to component file 

<input type="text" [value]="username" #userName (keyup.enter)="updatedname(userName)">

updatedname(userName:any){
    this.username = userName.value
    console.log(this.username)
}
**THIS IS OLD APPROCH TO TWO WAY DATA BINDING FINDOUT ANGULAR APPROCH BELOW**

second approch:
===============
in two way data binding iueing ngmodel
[(ngModel)] = 'userName'
we need to import this ngModel in imports in ts file 
**formsModule**

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" >


ONEWAY VS TWOWAY DATA BINDING:
=============================
one way data binding will bind data from the component to view

we can pass data from component to view 
send data from view to component
