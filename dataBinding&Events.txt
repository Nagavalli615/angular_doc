STRING INTERPOLATION:
=====================

what we give in ts file render in html file with {{}} in between brases

this is called string interpolation

why we called this string interpolation?

the main reason is what we give inbitween the brases 
eod it gives string type only 

{{1+2}} if we give like this 
ans: 3 will display but the type of the 3 is string 

what we give inbetween the brases boolean or string or numaric values 
eod it convert the data into string


PROPERTY BINDING:
=================
if want to display imag property from ts o ui 
use {{}} this 

<img src"what wegivein ts file variable"/>
this is one way to bind imag 

but better practice is property binding like below

for property binding we use [] 
use [] for src to bind the image fromts file 



CLASS BINDING:
==============
if we want to apply changes conditionally with css 
we use class binding 

for this class binding 
[class.active] = 'isactive'

in this cinario CLASS is property
ACTIVE is css class 
ISACTIVE is ts file varible

if we set isactive = true 
and active {
backgroundcolour : green}

it will dipplay in ui green clr 

in class binding we do changes with string also 

 <button [class.apple]="fruit == 'apple'">change with string</button> 
like this 

in ts file fruit:string = 'apple';
class.apple -- apple is css class styles
