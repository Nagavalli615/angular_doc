Angular directives:
==================
angular directives are classes that add additional behaviour to elements in new angular applications
they allow you to manipulate the dom directly it is important to for  createing dynamic and interactive web applications.


y r directives imp??
====================
directives the fundamental concept in angular they anable developers like us to extend functionality of html by creating custom behaviour 
that can be reuse across our application. so with that dir we can change appearcne,behaviour  and layout of dom element our app more dynamic and userfrendly.
 


there are 3 types of directives:

	*1. component directive
	*2. structural directives
	*3. Attribute directive

COMPONENT DIRECTIVE:
====================
these are the most commonly used directives
a component directivw is essentiolly a custom 
element with its own view and behaviour.
every angular component is a direcctive with a 
template.


STRUCTURAL DIRECTIVES:
======================
these directives alther the layout of the dom by 
adding or removeing elements. common examples 
include ngif,ngfor, and ngswitch.

we previously use structural directives syntax *ngif , *ngFor , *ngSwitch 

but updates syntax is @if ,@For,@Switch

if we want work with directives import module NgIf in app.component.ts imports.
in old way if we want use else condion we write another tag for that like


<h2 *ngIf="isenable">{{user}}</h2>

<h1 *ngIf="!isenable">user not found</h1>

******************************use ng-template to alternative of ngelse(!isenable)***************
CHECK NG-TEMPLATE FILE FOR INDETAILED.


NEW WAY
========
but in new syntax is very simple to define else condition

@if(isenable){
  <h3 style="color: red;">{{user}}</h3>
}
@else{
  <h3 style="color: green;">{{user}}</h3>
}



		NUMBER VALUES CONDITIONS 
		========================



ATTRIBUTE DIRECTIVE:
===================
these directive change the appearnce or behaviour of an element,
component, or another directive.
common example include ngclass and ngstyle.

CUSTOM DIRECTIVES:
=================
which can create our own custom directives from scratch.
