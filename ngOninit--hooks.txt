		why do we need ngOninit most?

INITIALIZATION:
==============

	its the perfect place to initialize your components data.

API CALLS:
==========

	if you need to fetch data from a server when your component loads,
onNginit is you'd typically do that.

COMPLEX SETUP:
=============
	any complex setup that shoudnt be in the constructor can go here.



ngOninit is called only once in the components lifecycle, right-after the component 
has been initialized.
