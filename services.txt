a services in angular is a class that provides specific functionality across 
multiple components in your application.
services are designed to handle tasks like data fetching, business logic,logging,
or nay operation that should be shared across components.


create service manually 
like create a folder and create a file with ts extention 


ProvideIn:root --> angular registers it at the root level, meaning it creates just one
instance of the service that can be shared across the whole app.

we dont have to manually create new instance or worry about passing services around between components.

making sure that were always working with single ,shared instance of the service. this keeps our app 
fast and memory-efficicent.
